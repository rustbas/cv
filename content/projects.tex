        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
            \item Calculated pairwise standard deviations of $\beta$-arches and clustered them using the hierarchical clustering method
            \item Reduced the number of measurements from 10 to 3 to visualize the distribution of $\beta$-arches over torsion angles using the principal component method
            \item Tested the hypothesis about the equality of medians of torsion angles for different types of $\beta$-arches using the Wilcoxon T-test
        \end{itemize}

    {
        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{-.5em}
            \item Developed an algorithm for constructing a graph based on the coordinates of intermediate points of the route, taking into account restricted areas
            \item Solved the problem of bypassing the forbidden zone
            \item Developed software for optimizing and visualizing the flight path for free and non-free routing
